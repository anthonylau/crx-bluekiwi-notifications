==========================

blueKiwi Notifier for Chrome.
blueKiwi Notifier is an unofficial Chrome extension made by Anthony Lau & Greg Hesp for the blueKiwi platform.

This is the beta-development branch which will utilise beta API's from Google, and as such may not work with the stable channel of Chrome.  
To use this version, you may need to switch to the beta channel of Chrome and enable additional flags.
